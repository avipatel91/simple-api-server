# Contributing

Contributors to this project are more than welcome! The aim of this project is to be as flexible as possible so there are not real restrictions on pull requests. However since this is a project aimed at newbies, it would be awesome to follow some best practices listed below:

## Best practices

1. Comment please! This cannot be stressed enough. Other people need to understand your code, and more importantly your pattern of thinking. So please    comment your code.
2. The JSCS file has been set to the Google javascript style guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml). It would be best if you followed this style guide for your code.

_I am aware that JSCS has merged with ESLint. I'm hoping to make that update soon._
